# OpenPose from Source Demo
This repository demonstrates my personal project where I compiled and ran [CMU OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) from source to process custom video and image inputs for non-commercial research purposes. Through this project, I explored OpenPose's capabilities, including 2D pose estimation for body, hand, and face keypoints, while integrating various input types like webcam, videos and images. The repository also highlights key learnings, troubleshooting steps, and efficient usage of OpenPose for multi-person detection scenarios. This serves as a comprehensive guide for anyone looking to set up and utilize OpenPose from source for their own research or academic projects.

## JSON
### Write JSON File and Analyze <br>
This section focuses on how to work with JSON files generated by OpenPose, including writing, organizing, and analyzing the data for downstream applications.

**JSON Files Overview**
- OpenPose outputs JSON files containing pose estimation data for each frame of the input video or image sequence.
- These JSON files provide:
  - Keypoints: 2D (x, y) coordinates for body parts.
  - Confidence Scores: Certainty of detection for each keypoint.


## Installation
1. Download OpenPose from [CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) in to working directory.
2. Install Required Tools and Libraries
   - Download [CMake-GUI](https://cmake.org/download/)
   - Download [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive) and [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive)
   - Check CUDA/cuDNN compatibility
     - [CUDA Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA)
     - [NVIDIA CUDA GPUs Compatibility](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus#compute)
3. Configure OpenPose with CMake
4. Build OpenPose
5. Verify/Test Installation

For detailed installation guide, refer to [Installation Guide](https://github.com/ggamangpro101/openpose-source-demo/blob/master/installation/0_installation.md)

## Download Dependencies
When you navigate to `..\openpose_initial\3rdparty\windows`, you will see several `.bat` files. These batch files are used to download and configure third-party dependencies required by OpenPose. However, running these `.bat` files directly in the `Command Prompt` might fail because some of the referenced websites are no longer accessible.

   <sup>getCaffe3rdparty.bat failed due to no connection</sup>
</p>

Download dependencies manually:
- [3rdparty_v1_2021.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WvftDLLEwAxeO2A-n12g5IFtfLbMY9mG/edit)


## Download Models
The `getModels.bat` script in `D:\my_programming\openpose\models` may fail to download the required models due to connectivity issues or the server being unavailable. To resolve this, you need to download the [models](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QCSxJZpnWvM00hx49CJ2zky7PWGzpcEh/edit) manually.

## Error Handling
### CMake-GUI “NOT FOUND” Error
When configuring and generating in CMake-GUI, you might encounter **"NOT FOUND"** errors for dependencies such as `Boost`, `Caffe`, `GFlags`, or `GLog`. These errors occur because the required `.lib` files are missing or their paths are not set correctly.  
  
### Model Error
The `getModels.bat` script in `D:\my_programming\openpose\models` may fail to download the required models due to connectivity issues or the server being unavailable. To resolve this, you need to download the [models](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QCSxJZpnWvM00hx49CJ2zky7PWGzpcEh/edit) manually. <br>
When you manually download the `model.zip` file and extract it, follow these steps carefully to replace the `.caffemodel` files without affecting other essential files, unless necessary for specific purposes.
